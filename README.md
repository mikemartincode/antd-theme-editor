These are personal changes I forked to make to the theme editor. These changes are most likely outdated and the original project is from minheq.

# Ant Design Theme Editor

Boilerplate to render [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) components into [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), so you can easily edit the theme

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/minheq/antd-theme-editor.git
yarn
yarn storybook
```

Visit `localhost:6006` to view Storybook

## Customizing theme

### Editing antd default variables

There is ready `src/antd-theme-override.less` for editing **antd default variables**

### Editing css antd classes

You can also edit css file `src/style-override.css` for overriding/editing styles of **antd classes**

## Exporting

After you are done editing the variables and styles, export via this command

```
yarn export
```

The exported files will be found in `dist` directory, copy and use in your project

## Updating stories

Stories are already created based on the antd repository. You can also update them by importing `antd` components via git submodules and running a script to create or update stories.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive // Adds antd submodule to the project
yarn create-stories                     // Creates the stories
```

The script runs the file `scripts/createStoriesFromAntdDemos.js`.
